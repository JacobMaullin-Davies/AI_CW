K-means algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset
into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data
point belongs to only one group.

Goal: given centroids a(1).....a(k), assign each point to the best centroid

The way k-means algorithm works:
Specify number of clusters K.
Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting
K data points for the centroids without replacement.
Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids
(assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing).
Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).
Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data
points that belong to each cluster.

This algorithm approach can be applied to the task of hand-written digit
recognition as the size of the dataset is known, which allows the user to assign
the clusters to each number. The k-means algorithm can be trained to understand
the numbers and identify from the cluster what the written number is.

The algorithm is only applicable if the mean is defined. K-means algorithm is
good in capturing the structure of data if the clusters have a spherical-like shape.
It will always try to construct a nice spherical shape around the centroid.
Additionally, the user needs to specify k.

Ex1 if the clusters have a complicated geometric shapes, k-means does a poor job in
clustering the data.

K-Means clustering algorithm is most sensitive to outliers as it uses the mean
of cluster data points to find the cluster centre.
If the data has many outliers, then k-means is more likely to fail.
